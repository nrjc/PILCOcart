\section*{Acknowledgments}

I would like to thank my supervisor, professor Carl Rasmussen for his countless support and encouragement with the project. His insights and explanations were always enormously helpful to me. Furthermore, I am really grateful for having a possibility to work on PILCO.

\noindent I would like to thank Paavo Parmas for sharing his version of the code responsible for running the experiments.
