In the project, PILCO is applied to the real 


-managed to make single pendulum work - third order representation
-investigate issues related to double pendulum.
this resulted in the improvement of the PILCO framework: the sequence of the linear models,
not convoluted
investigated that the direct method for GP time-series model is not good enough dynamics model for the problem
-extend it by having more than one parametric model
-although manage to swing it up and there are trials to keep it balanced, the task remains unsuccesful.
