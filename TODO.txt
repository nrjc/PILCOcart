> minimize - derivative only fix - CARL

> Devise solution for barrier function problems in training

> Convert trigAug to gTrig and fillIn

> Work out where to get the noise variances for the policy inputs from in the case of multiple dynamics models and/or 
correctly provided values in plant - JOE. done (slightly hacky)

> Get trainNIGP to work with multiple dynamics models - ANDREW

> Change dynmodel.noise to something more appropriately named - ANDREW

> Convert propagated, all controllers, gps, saturations, conCat, and g- functions to return vectorised derivatives
..looks much tidier in the case of gSat, conlin and propagated...and requires only reshaping at the end of the other functions.
@Joe: DONE

> Check dSdp in propagated with a linear controller. Sorted (Joe)
