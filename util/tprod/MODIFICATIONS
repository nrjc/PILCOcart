The following minor changes were made in "tprod_mex.c"

1) changed the default block size from 32 to 64 which is probably
   slightly more efficient on our machines:

   const int DEFAULTBLKSZ=64;

2) commented out the warning for calling with empty matrices:

   /* WARNING("tprod: Empty matrix input!"); */
